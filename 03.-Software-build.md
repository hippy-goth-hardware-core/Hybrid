## Build with CMake (CMakeLists.txt)[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#build-with-cmake-cmakeliststxt)

### `cmake` quick build

First, you should have [clone sources](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/wiki/01.-Clone-source-codes). Then open command line Terminal and call these commands:

*Step 1:* Initialize cache and build configuration in folder './build' folder. *Default options:* g++ compiler, release build, enabled examples and unit tests
```bash
cmake -B ./build
```
*Step 2:* Compile sources.
```bash
cmake --build ./build -j 8
 ```

### `cmake` details

To build the sources using the `cmake` tool, you have the flexibility to choose between Linux (POSIX API) and Windows (POSIX and Win32 API) depending on the compilers used. For building the POSIX API on Windows, you can utilize [_Cygwin_](https://www.cygwin.com/). The supported compilers include GNU gcc/g++, LLVM clang/clang++, and Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). Please note that other compilers have not been tested yet.

The following table provides an overview of the compilers, platforms, APIs, and their respective compatibility:

| Compiler           | Platform                  | API   | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| GNU gcc/g++        | Linux, Cygwin (Windows)   | POSIX | Compilation under Windows requires Cygwin             |
| LLVM clang/clang++ | Linux                     | POSIX | Compiles only under Linux                             |
| MSVC (cl)          | Windows                   | Win32 | Compiles only under Windows                           |

By default, `cmake` is configured with the following settings: 
- A shared library for AREG framework
- Release build mode
- Examples, unit tests, and framework are enabled
- `areg-extensions` is included without extra dependencies

The compiler type, platform, bitness, and CPU are automatically detected. The compiler is set to `GNU g++` for Linux, `Cygwin g++` for Cygwin on Windows, and `MSVC` for Windows. The binary files are located in the path `<areg-sdk>/product/build/<compiler>/<platform>-<bitness>-<cpu>-release/bin`. Here, `<compiler>` can have one of the following values: `gnu-g++`, `cygwin-g++`, or `msvc-cl`.

You have the option to customize the build settings according to your project requirements. `CMake` supports several command-line options that can be used:

| Option                   | Default       | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AREG_COMPILER_FAMILY** | `gnu`         | Sets the C++ and C compilers based on the selected family.                                |
| **AREG_COMPILER**        | `g++`         | Sets the specific compiler for the C++ compiler variable (`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`).          |
| **AREG_BINARY**          | `shared`      | Defines the type of AREG framework library.                                               |
| **AREG_BUILD_TYPE**      | `Release`     | Specifies the build configuration for the sources.                                        |
| **AREG_BUILD_TESTS**     | `ON`          | Indicates whether to build the unit tests.                                                |
| **AREG_BUILD_EXAMPLES**  | `ON`          | Indicates whether to build the examples.                                                  |
| **AREG_EXTENDED**        | `OFF`         | Enables or disables building the `areg-extensions` static library with extended features. |
| **AREG_LOGS**            | `ON`          | Indicates whether to compile the source codes with or without logs.                       |
| **AREG_BUILD_ROOT**      | `product`     | The root directory for project(s) to build.                                               |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_DIR**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the output binaries will be located.               |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_BIN**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the runtime binaries will be located.              |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_LIB**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the static libraries will be located.              |

Here are a couple of examples demonstrating the usage of `cmake` with different options:

**Example 1:** Initializes cache and configures a Debug build of binaries linked with a static AREG framework using LLVM clang++/clang compilers, and disables logs.

*Step 1:* Initialize cache and configure the build:
```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_COMPILER_FAMILY=llvm -DAREG_BINARY=static -DAREG_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DAREG_LOGS:BOOL=OFF
```

*Step 2:* Build the project with 10 parallel jobs:
```bash
cmake --build ./build -j 10
```

**Example 2:** Initializes cache and configures a Debug build of binaries with the gcc compiler, enables extension features, and changes the location of the resulting binaries:

*Step 1:* Initialize cache and configure the build:
```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_COMPILER=gcc -DAREG_EXTENDED:BOOL=ON -DAREG_OUTPUT_BIN="~/builds/areg/"
```

*Step 2:* Build the project with 10 parallel jobs:
```bash
cmake --build ./build -j 10
```

> ðŸ’¡ For additional examples demonstrating various `cmake` options, you can refer to the [CMake Workflow](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/cmake.yml) file in the AREG SDK repository.

## Build with Make (Makefile)[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#build-with-make-makefile)

### `make` quick build

First, you should have [clone sources](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/wiki/01.-Clone-source-codes). Then open command line Terminal and call these command to build applications. *Default options:* g++ compiler, release build, enabled examples and unit tests:
```bash
make -j8
```

### `make` details

You can use the `make` tool to build the AREG sources on both Linux and Windows platforms, utilizing the POSIX API. For building on Windows, you will need to use [_Cygwin_](https://www.cygwin.com/) along with GNU compilers. Please note that the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler is not supported, and compatibility with other compilers has not been tested yet.

The following table summarizes the supported compilers, platforms, and APIs:

| Compiler           | Platform                  | API   | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| GNU gcc/g++        | Linux, Cygwin (Windows)   | POSIX | Compiling under Windows requires Cygwin               |
| LLVM clang/clang++ | Linux                     | POSIX | Compiles only under Linux                             |

The default `make` settings include building the AREG framework as a shared library in the Release build mode. The build includes examples and the framework itself, including the `areg-extensions` module without any additional dependencies. The compiler type, platform, bitness, and CPU are automatically detected. For Linux, the compiler is set to `GNU g++`, and for Cygwin on Windows, it is set to `Cygwin g++`. The resulting binary files are located in the path `<areg-sdk>/product/build/<compiler>/<platform>-<bitness>-<cpu>-release/bin`, where `<compiler>` can have one of the following values: `gnu-g++`, `cygwin-g++`, or `msvc-cl`.

You have the option to customize the build settings according to your project requirements. The `make` tool supports several command-line options that can be passed:

| Option                   | Default       | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AREG_COMPILER_FAMILY** | `gnu`         | Sets the C++ and C compilers based on the selected family.                                |
| **AREG_COMPILER**        | `g++`         | Sets the specific compiler for the C++ compiler variable (`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`).          |
| **AREG_BINARY**          | `shared`      | Defines the type of AREG framework library.                                               |
| **AREG_BUILD_TYPE**      | `Release`     | Specifies the build configuration for the sources.                                        |
| **AREG_EXTENDED**        | `0`           | Enables or disables building the `areg-extensions` static library with extended features. |
| **AREG_LOGS**            | `1`           | Indicates whether to compile the source codes with or without logs.                       |
| **AREG_BUILD_ROOT**      | `product`     | The root directory for project(s) to build.                                               |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_DIR**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the output binaries will be located.               |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_BIN**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the runtime binaries will be located.              |
| **AREG_OUTPUT_LIB**      | `product/...` | Specifies the path to the folder where the static libraries will be located.              |

Here are a couple of examples demonstrating the usage of `make` with different options:

**Example 1:** This example demonstrates how to build only the AREG framework in Debug mode using LLVM clang++/clang compilers, producing a static library:
```bash
make framework AREG_COMPILER_FAMILY=llvm AREG_BINARY=static AREG_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -j10
```

**Example 2:** This example demonstrates how to build all binaries in Debug mode using the gcc compiler with enabled extended features, and specifying a custom output location for the resulting binaries:
```bash
make AREG_COMPILER=gcc AREG_EXTENDED=1 AREG_OUTPUT_BIN="~/builds/areg/" -j10
```

> ðŸ’¡ Another example utilizing various `make` options can be found in the [C/C++ CI Workflow](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml) file of the AREG SDK repository.
