## General Information[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#general-information)

The AREG SDK utilizes preprocessor-defined symbols to configure the compilation of the framework and applications in a clear and professional manner. These symbols allow for easy customization and adjustment of the compilation process. Here is a description of the available preprocessor defines and their meanings:

| Preprocessor      | Description and Meaning                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **POSIX**         | Compiles the sources with the POSIX API. Further details can be found in [POSIX.md](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/POSIX.md). |
| **WINDOWS**       | Compiles the sources with the Win32 API. Further details can be found in [WIN32.md](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/WIN32.md). |
| **DEBUG**         | Compiles the Debug configuration.                                                         |
| **NDEBUG**        | Compiles the Release configuration.                                                       |
| **EXP_AREG_LIB**  | Builds the AREG framework as a static library (equivalent to **EXPORT_STATIC_SYMBOLS**).  |
| **EXP_AREG_DLL**  | Builds the AREG framework as a shared library (equivalent to **EXPORT_SHARED_SYMBOLS**).  |
| **IMP_AREG_LIB**  | Links with the static AREG framework library (equivalent to **IMPORT_STATIC_SYMBOLS**).   |
| **IMP_AREG_DLL**  | Links with the shared AREG framework library (equivalent to **IMPORT_SHARED_SYMBOLS**).   |
| **AREG_EXTENDED** | Builds the *areg-extensions* library with extended features.                              |
| **AREG_LOGS**     | Compiles the source codes with logs.                                                      |

These preprocessor-define symbols can be set in multiple ways:
- In the `Makefile` or `CMakeLists.txt` files.
- In the project properties of Microsoft Visual Studio.
- In the [user.props](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/msvc/user.props), [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake), or [user.mk](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.mk) files, depending on the chosen toolchain. Changes made in these files have a global effect.

> ðŸ’¡ Before proceeding with any example, open the command line Terminal in the root folder of the `areg-sdk`.

## `POSIX` define[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#posix-define)

The `POSIX` preprocessor define is utilized to compile the _AREG Framework_ sources using the [POSIX API](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/POSIX.md). This define is compatible with all compilers except Microsoft Visual C++ (`MSVC`). The `POSIX` preprocessor define is indirectly set when configuring the compiler. This can be achieved by selecting the compiler through options such as the `AREG_COMPILER_FAMILY` parameter or by directly modifying the configuration file, such as the [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake) file.

For instance, here's an example of how to set the `POSIX` define when building with CMake and utilizing the LLVM (Clang) compiler family:

```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_COMPILER_FAMILY=llvm
cmake --build ./build -j8
```

Similarly, when building with Make and employing the GCC compiler, the `POSIX` define can be set as follows:

```bash
make AREG_COMPILER=gcc all -j8
```

The `POSIX` build is also possible in Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code when the GNU, LLVM, or Cygwin compiler family is selected. It is important to remember that the `POSIX` and `WINDOWS` preprocessor defines are mutually exclusive, and only one of them can be set at a time.

<div align="right">[ <a href="#table-of-contents">â†‘ Back to top â†‘</a> ]</div>

---

## `WINDOWS` define[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#windows-define)

The `WINDOWS` preprocessor define is used to compile the _AREG Framework_ sources with the [Win32 API](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/docs/WIN32.md). It is specifically set when compiling with the *Microsoft Visual C++* (`MSVC`) compiler. The `WINDOWS` define is automatically established when compiling with *Microsoft Visual Studio*, or it is automatically configured by selecting the compiler options such as the `AREG_COMPILER_FAMILY` parameter, or by modifying the configuration file, such as the [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake) file.

Here's an example of how to set the `WINDOWS` define when building with CMake and utilizing the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler:

```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_COMPILER_FAMILY=msvc
cmake --build ./build -j8
```

Please note that the `WINDOWS` define is only applicable when compiling with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. It's important to remember that the `WINDOWS` and `POSIX` preprocessor defines are mutually exclusive, and only one of them can be set at a time.

## `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` defines[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#debug-and-ndebug-defines)

The **DEBUG** and **NDEBUG** preprocessor define symbols are used to specify the build type, either _Debug_ or _Release_, and they are mutually exclusive.

### `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` Build with CMake

In CMake, the **DEBUG** and **NDEBUG** preprocessor defines are set indirectly by specifying the build type as either _Debug_ or _Release_ using the **AREG_BUILD_TYPE** compile option. This compile option can be set either through the command line or in the [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake) file.

**Example:** The **DEBUG** define is set due to a _Debug_ build:
```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build ./build
```

### `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` Build with Make

In Make, the **DEBUG** and **NDEBUG** preprocessor defines are set indirectly by specifying the build type as either _Debug_ or _Release_ using the **AREG_BUILD_TYPE** compile option. This compile option can be set either through the command line or in the [user.make](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.make) file.

**Example:** The **NDEBUG** define is set due to a _Debug_ build:
```bash
make AREG_BUILD_TYPE=Release all -j 8
```

### `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` Build with Microsoft Visual Studio

In Microsoft Visual Studio, the various build configurations are set in the [areg-sdk.sln](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/areg-sdk.sln) solution file. When opening the `areg-sdk.sln` file, the developer should select the desired configuration in the Configuration Manager or in the Toolbar.

![Select configuration in Microsoft Visual Studio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/aregtech/main/wiki/areg-sdk/define/msvc-debug-toolbar.png)

Another way to set the build type is to use CMake in Microsoft Visual Studio and specify the **AREG_BUILD_TYPE** parameter as either _Debug_ or _Release_, following the same steps described in the [DEBUG and NDEBUG Build with CMake](#debug-and-ndebug-build-with-cmake) section of this documentation.

### `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` Build with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the **DEBUG** and **NDEBUG** defines are set in the same way as described in the [DEBUG and NDEBUG Build with CMake](#debug-and-ndebug-build-with-cmake) section of this documentation.

## `EXP_AREG_DLL` and `EXP_AREG_LIB` defines[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#exp_areg_dll-and-exp_areg_lib-defines)

The preprocessor defines **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB** are specific to the _AREG Framework_ and are used to ensure the proper export of classes and functions when building the `areg` library as either a shared library or a static library. These symbols are set indirectly in the configuration file when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. It is important to note that these symbols are mutually exclusive, and only one of them should be set at a time.

> ðŸ’¡ Similar to **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB**, there are preprocessor defines **EXPORT_SHARED_SYMBOLS** and **EXPORT_STATIC_SYMBOLS** that can be used in project configurations.

### `EXP_AREG_DLL` and `EXP_AREG_LIB` with CMake

In CMake, the **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set for the `areg` library when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. By default, the library is built as a shared library (check the _AREG_BINARY_ parameter in [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake)).

**Example:** Configure the `areg` library as shared, which will automatically set the value **EXP_AREG_DLL=1**
```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_BINARY=shared
```

### `EXP_AREG_DLL` and `EXP_AREG_LIB` with Make

In Make, the **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. By default, the library is built as a shared library (check the _AREG_BINARY_ parameter in [user.make](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.make)).

**Example:** Configure the `areg` library as shared, which will automatically set the value **EXP_AREG_LIB=1**
```bash
make AREG_BINARY=static
```

### `EXP_AREG_DLL` and `EXP_AREG_LIB` with Microsoft Visual Studio

In Microsoft Visual Studio, the **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set directly in the `areg` project when compiling using the `areg-sdk.sln` solution file (compiler set as _shared_), or indirectly when using CMake, as described in the [EXP_AREG_DLL and EXP_AREG_LIB with CMake](#exp_areg_dll-and-exp_areg_lib-with-cmake) section.

### `EXP_AREG_DLL` and `EXP_AREG_LIB` with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the **EXP_AREG_DLL** and **EXP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set in the same way as described in the [EXP_AREG_DLL and EXP_AREG_LIB with CMake](#exp_areg_dll-and-exp_areg_lib-with-cmake) section.

## `IMP_AREG_DLL` and `IMP_AREG_LIB` defines[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#imp_areg_dll-and-imp_areg_lib-defines)

The preprocessor defines **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB** are specific to projects that utilize the _AREG Framework_ and are used to ensure the proper import of classes and functions from the `areg` shared or static library when building the target executable. These symbols are set indirectly in the configuration file when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. It is important to note that these symbols are mutually exclusive, and only one of them should be set at a time.

> ðŸ’¡ Similar to **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB**, there are preprocessor defines **IMPORT_SHARED_SYMBOLS** and **IMPORT_STATIC_SYMBOLS** that can be used in project configurations.

### `IMP_AREG_DLL` and `IMP_AREG_LIB` with CMake

In CMake, the **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set for the target executables when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. By default, the library is built as a shared library (check the _AREG_BINARY_ parameter in [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake)).

**Example:** Set the `areg` binary as shared so that the executables can properly import symbols. This automatically sets **EXP_AREG_DLL=1**
```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_BINARY=shared
```

### `IMP_AREG_DLL` and `IMP_AREG_LIB` with Make

In Make, the **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set for the target executables when specifying the binary type of the _AREG Framework_. By default, the library is built as a shared library (check the _AREG_BINARY_ parameter in [user.make](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.make)).

**Example:** Set the `areg` binary as static so that the executables can link the symbols properly. This automatically sets **EXP_AREG_LIB=1**
```bash
make AREG_BINARY=static
```

### `IMP_AREG_DLL` and `IMP_AREG_LIB` with Microsoft Visual Studio

In Microsoft Visual Studio, the **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set directly in the project files when compiling using the `areg-sdk.sln` solution file, or indirectly when using CMake, as described in the [IMP_AREG_DLL and IMP_AREG_LIB with CMake](#imp_areg_dll-and-imp_areg_lib-with-cmake) section.

### `IMP_AREG_DLL` and `IMP_AREG_LIB` with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the **IMP_AREG_DLL** and **IMP_AREG_LIB** preprocessor define symbols are set in the same way as described in the [IMP_AREG_DLL and IMP_AREG_LIB with CMake](#imp_areg_dll-and-imp_areg_lib-with-cmake) section.

## `AREG_EXTENDED` define[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#areg_extended-define)

The `AREG_EXTENDED` preprocessor define symbol is used to control the inclusion of extended features in the `areg-extensions` static library. By default, the library is built without the extended features enabled. The possible values for `AREG_EXTENDED` are `0` or `1`, where `0` disables the extended features and `1` enables them. It's important to note that enabling extended features may introduce additional dependencies.

For instance, on Linux, the extended feature requires the `ncurses` library, while on Windows, it requires minimum Windows 2000 Professional Desktop Apps only. Due to these dependencies, extended features are disabled by default. Building the library without extended features and additional dependencies (setting `AREG_EXTENDED` to `0`) may cause certain functionalities to not work as expected.

### `AREG_EXTENDED` with CMake

By default, extended features are disabled in CMake. To enable them, you have two options. You can manually modify the `AREG_EXTENDED` option in the [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake) file, or you can pass it as a compile option via the command line during the configuration process.

Here's an example of using CMake to build applications with enabled extended features:

```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_EXTENDED:BOOL=ON
cmake --build build
```

### `AREG_EXTENDED` with Make

By default, extended features are disabled in Make. To enable them, you can either manually modify the `AREG_EXTENDED` parameter in the [user.mk](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.mk) file or pass the parameter through the command line during the build process.

Here's an example of compiling applications with enabled extended features using Make:

```bash
make AREG_EXTENDED=1
```

### `AREG_EXTENDED` with Microsoft Visual Studio

By default, the extended features of AREG SDK are disabled. To enable the extended features of the AREG Framework when compile with Microsoft Visual Studio, follow these steps:

1. Open the [`msvc_setup.props`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/msvc_setup.props) file in the AREG SDK root directory. If you are integrating AREG SDK into your project, create the file in your project's Solution directory instead.
2. Locate the `AregExtended` property in the file and set its value based on your requirements. For example:
   ```xml
   <AregExtended>1</AregExtended>
   ```
3. Save the `msvc_setup.props` file either in the AREG SDK root directory or your project's Solution directory.

No further changes are necessary. In the [`user.props`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/msvc/user.props) file the `AREG_EXTENDED` preprocessor define symbol is set as follows:
```xml
<AregExtended Condition="'$(AregExtended)'==''">0</AregExtended>
<AregCommonDefines>AREG_EXTENDED=$(AregExtended);$(AregCommonDefines)</AregCommonDefines>
```

Alternatively, you can enable the extended features via the command line when running MSBuild. Use the following example command:
```batch
msbuild /m /property:Configuration=Release /property:Platform=x64 /property:AregExtended=1 ./areg-sdk.sln
```

Make sure to adjust the command according to your specific requirements.

Please note that enabling the extended features may have certain prerequisites or dependencies that need to be met for proper functionality.

### `AREG_EXTENDED` with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the `AREG_EXTENDED` preprocessor define symbol is set in the same way as described in the [AREG_EXTENDED with CMake](#areg_extended-with-cmake) section.

## `AREG_LOGS` define[![](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/raw/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#areg_logs-define)

The `AREG_LOGS` preprocessor define symbol is used to control the inclusion of logs in the compiled binaries. When `AREG_LOGS` is not set or set to `1`, the application source codes are compiled with logs, allowing developers to configure the [`log.init`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/framework/areg/resources/log.init) file for runtime logging. On the other hand, if `AREG_LOGS` is set to `0`, the applications are compiled without logs.

### `AREG_LOGS` with CMake

By default, CMake compiles the application source codes with logs. To compile the sources without logs, developers need to either modify the `AREG_LOGS` option in the [user.cmake](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/cmake/user.cmake) file or pass it as a compile option through the command line during the build configuration.

Here's an example of building applications without logs using CMake:

```bash
cmake -B ./build -DAREG_LOGS:BOOL=OFF
cmake --build ./build
```

### `AREG_LOGS` with Make

By default, Make compiles the application source codes with logs. To compile the sources without logs, developers need to either modify the `AREG_LOGS` parameter in the [user.mk](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/make/user.mk) file or pass it as a parameter through the command line during the build process.

Here's an example of building applications without logs using Make:

```bash
make AREG_LOGS=0
```

### `AREG_LOGS` with Microsoft Visual Studio

By default, the source codes are compiled with logs. To disable logs in binaries when using Microsoft Visual Studio, follow these steps:

1. Open the [`msvc_setup.props`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/msvc_setup.props) file located in the AREG SDK root directory. If you are integrating AREG SDK into your project, create the file in your project's Solution directory instead.

2. Locate the `AregLogs` property in the file and set its value to disable logs. For example:
   ```xml
   <AregLogs>0</AregLogs>
   ```

3. Save the `msvc_setup.props` file in the AREG SDK root directory or your project's Solution directory.

No further changes are required in the [`user.props`](https://github.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/blob/master/conf/msvc/user.props) file. The `AREG_LOGS` preprocessor define symbol is set as follows:
   ```xml
   <AregLogs Condition="'$(AregLogs)'==''">1</AregLogs>
   <AregCommonDefines>AREG_LOGS=$(AregLogs);$(AregCommonDefines)</AregCommonDefines>
   ```

Alternatively, you can disable logs via the command line when running MSBuild in the Solution directory. Use the following example command:
```batch
msbuild /m /property:Configuration=Release /property:Platform=x64 /property:AregLogs=0 .
```

Adjust the command based on your specific requirements.

Please note that disabling logs may impact the debugging and troubleshooting capabilities of your application.

### `AREG_LOGS` with Visual Studio Code

In Visual Studio Code, the `AREG_LOGS` preprocessor define symbol is set in the same way as described in the [AREG_LOGS with CMake](#areg_logs-with-cmake) section.
